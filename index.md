_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify risks](Report/report.md)**_

This program aimed to examine companies in the S&P 500, measure the sentiment of each companyâ€™s 10 K, and examine the returns after the 10 Ks were filed. The final results were different scatterplots to measure each given measure and a correlation table showing the strength of the connection between the sentiment and the return(Shown Below). The Variables here are the returns 3 days after and 10 days after, based on 2 different dictionaries, and sentiment around Supply chain, Risk, and Competition.

## Career Objectives

I want to break into the Fintech realm to utilize my strong quantitative and coding skills. Before entering this growing industry, I want to gain a strong background in traditional finance and see what the market looks like! In the summer of 2024, I worked as a Data Analysis intern in Milan, Italy, with E4Impact. I was able to dip my toes in the finance area and see what doing valuations was like in a real business environment.

## Hobbies

I love playing golf and have been playing for 13 years now! I also enjoy exercising and am on Lehigh's club tennis team. I am also an avid sports fan with the Mets being my favorite team, but I also closely follow the Jets, Knicks, and Rangers.
